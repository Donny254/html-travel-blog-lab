        <h1>Adventures In Fire Island </h1>

        <p>Last summer, I wandered into a tiny coastal town just as the sun was dipping low. The air smelled of salt and grilled fish from little beachside stalls, and the waves made that perfect rhythmic hush against the shore. I kicked off my shoes, walked along the damp sand until it turned cool under my feet, and sat on a weathered pier watching fishing boats bob in the golden light. An old man nearby handed me a cold bottle of local lemonade without a word, just a nod and a smile. For those quiet twenty minutes, with gulls overhead and the horizon glowing pink, everything felt uncomplicated and exactly right. I still think about that evening whenever I need to remember the world can be gentle.
